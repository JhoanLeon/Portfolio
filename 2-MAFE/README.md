# MAFE

## Summary
- Degree project as a Technician in 2017 
- 8+ months of development
- 5 handmade single layer PCBs 
- 2 PIC Microcontrollers like in a dual core implementation
- Integration with Bluetooth app for remote control

## Description
This was my degree project for the title of Technician in Electricity and Electronics. It condensed all of my knowledge in electronics at that time into an ambitious application: a fully automated house with remote control through Bluetooth. The project consisted of a complete electronic system with all subcircuits to perform tasks like controlling lights, opening doors, setting alarms, and even displaying information on a physical screen. The name of the project, MAFE, is an acronym in Spanish for Automation Model for Conventional Houses (Modelo de Automatizaci√≥n Para Casas Convencionales).

This project was designed in PROTEUS 8 PROFESSIONAL with two PIC16F877A microcontrollers as the main controllers, programmed in C language using PIC C COMPILER and PICkit2. The five modules were designed to avoid having one large, complex PCB and to simplify wiring inside the model house. The five modules are as follows:

- Control: Microcontroller board with numerous IO for all the house peripherals. The top layer traces were essentially jumper wires.

- Power: Relays for high-power loads. This board includes an 8-relay driver circuit with a logic control signal of 5VDC for 110-220VAC loads.

- Sensors: Doors and windows switches. This circuit connects reed switches and IR sensors to detect events in the house.

- Motors: For doors, windows, and garage actuators. This PCB contains H-bridges and servo drivers to control moving parts in the house.

- Communication: Bluetooth and LCD circuits. Additionally, this module includes transistorized drivers for DC loads like ambient lighting and sirens.

The project was challenging enough for my younger self, and all of those boards were designed, programmed, and manufactured by me. The AC-DC converter was repurposed from an old printer to avoid the complexity of designing that power stage. Ultimately, the project worked well; I earned my Technician degree, and the model house turned out great.
